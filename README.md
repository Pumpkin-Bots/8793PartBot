# 8793PartBot — Automated Parts Purchasing System for FRC Robotics

## Overview
8793PartBot is an automation system built for **FRC Team 8793 – Pumpkin Bots** to streamline:
- Part requests from students via Discord slash commands
- **User-specified SKU override** for multi-variant product pages (NEW!)
- Automatic SKU/name extraction via AI (Google Gemini 2.5 Flash)
- Real-time inventory lookup
- Student self-service request cancellation
- Purchasing approvals and workflow management
- Order tracking with ETA notifications
- Discord ↔ Google Sheets integration

It replaces DM chaos, ad‑hoc spreadsheets, and manual vendor lookups with a structured, automated workflow.

## Features

### 🎯 User SKU Override (NEW!)
Students can now specify exact SKUs when requesting parts from multi-variant product pages:
```
/requestpart subsystem:Drive link:https://wcproducts.com/products/ball-bearings sku:WCP-0785 qty:4
```

**Why this matters:**
- Product pages like WCP ball bearings have multiple SKUs (WCP-0783, WCP-0784, WCP-0785, etc.)
- AI might guess the wrong variant based on notes alone
- User-specified SKU **overrides AI detection** and guarantees the correct part
- Still optional - AI enrichment works normally if SKU not provided

**Example use case:**
```
Without SKU field:
/requestpart subsystem:Drive link:https://wcproducts.com/products/ball-bearings qty:4 notes:"1/2 inch flanged"
→ AI might extract WCP-0783 (wrong variant) ❌

With SKU field:
/requestpart subsystem:Drive link:https://wcproducts.com/products/ball-bearings sku:WCP-0785 qty:4
→ Guaranteed WCP-0785 (correct variant) ✅
```

### 🔧 AI-Powered Part Enrichment (Gemini 2.5 Flash)
Automatically extracts from a vendor URL:
- Part name
- SKU / product code (unless user-specified)
- Estimated price

**Supported vendors:**
- ✅ West Coast Products (WCP)
- ✅ REV Robotics
- ✅ VexPro
- ✅ AndyMark
- ✅ Amazon (URL-based extraction)
- ✅ McMaster-Carr (SKU-based extraction)
- ✅ CTRE
- ✅ Studica
- ✅ Redux Robotics
- ✅ Thrifty Bot

**Fallback strategies:**
- **Amazon:** Extracts product name from URL slug + ASIN
- **McMaster-Carr:** Extracts SKU from URL pattern
- **Other vendors:** Intelligent pattern matching

**Smart SKU handling:**
- If user provides SKU → AI only enriches Part Name and Price
- If user omits SKU → AI enriches Part Name, SKU, and Price
- User SKU always takes precedence over AI detection

### 💬 Discord Slash Commands
Students request parts using intuitive slash commands:
```
/requestpart subsystem:Drive link:<URL> sku:WCP-0785 qty:2 priority:High notes:"For shooter prototype"
```

**All commands:**
- `/requestpart` - Submit a new part request (now with optional `sku` field!)
- `/cancelrequest` - Cancel your own request
- `/inventory` - Search inventory by SKU or keyword
- `/openorders` - View all pending orders and denied requests
- `/orderstatus` - Check status of a specific request or order

### 🚫 Request Cancellation
Students can cancel their own requests:
```
/cancelrequest requestid:REQ-12345678 reason:No longer needed
```

**Security features:**
- ✅ Can only cancel your own requests
- ✅ Cannot cancel if already ordered/received/complete
- ✅ Timestamps and audit trail in mentor notes
- ✅ Row turns gray when cancelled
- ✅ Status set to "🚫 Cancelled"

### 📦 Order Tracking
- `/openorders` – displays all non-received orders
- `/orderstatus requestid:REQ-xxxx` – detailed status for a request
- `/orderstatus orderid:ORD-xxxx` – detailed status for an order
- ETAs shown in human-readable format (e.g., "Dec 15, 2024")
- Tracking numbers displayed when available

### 📚 Inventory Lookup
```
/inventory sku:WCP-0783
/inventory search:bearing
/inventory search:BIN-001
```
Returns:
- Stock on hand (aggregated across multiple locations)
- Location(s)
- Vendor
- Part name

Supports:
- Exact SKU matching
- Fuzzy keyword search
- Location-based lookup (BIN-xxx, RACK-xxx)

### 🛠 Automated Workflow
1. Student submits `/requestpart` in Discord (optionally with specific SKU)
2. Apps Script creates request in Google Sheets
3. **User-provided SKU written immediately** (if specified)
4. **AI enrichment (Gemini)** extracts part details from URL
   - If user provided SKU → AI only fills Part Name and Price
   - If no user SKU → AI fills Part Name, SKU, and Price
5. System checks inventory for existing stock
6. Mentor reviews and approves in Google Sheets
7. **Student can cancel** using `/cancelrequest` (if not yet ordered)
8. Approved requests automatically moved to Orders sheet
9. Order status tracked until received
10. Denied requests flagged in `/openorders` for visibility

**Status workflow:**
- **📥 Submitted** → Initial request state
- **👀 Under Review** → Pending mentor review
- **✅ Approved** → Auto-creates order in Orders sheet
- **🛒 Ordered** → Tracking and ETA management
- **📦 Received** → Auto-adds to inventory with location prompt
- **✔️ Complete** → Marks request as done, grays out row
- **❌ Denied** → Prompts for reason, highlights row red
- **🚫 Cancelled** → Student-initiated cancellation, grays out row

## Command Reference

### `/requestpart` - Submit New Request
```
/requestpart 
  subsystem:Drive           # Required: Drive, Intake, Shooter, etc.
  link:https://...          # Optional: Vendor URL (triggers AI enrichment)
  sku:WCP-0785              # Optional: Exact SKU (overrides AI detection) ⭐ NEW!
  qty:2                     # Optional: Quantity (default: 1)
  maxbudget:50              # Optional: Maximum budget in USD
  priority:High             # Optional: Critical, High, Medium, Low
  notes:"For prototype"     # Optional: Additional context
```

**What happens:**
1. Request created in Google Sheets
2. **User SKU written immediately** (if provided)
3. AI enrichment extracts part name, SKU (if not user-specified), price from URL
4. Notification sent to Discord procurement channel
5. Discord shows: `SKU: **WCP-0785** (user-specified)` if you provided it
6. Request ID returned (e.g., REQ-12345678)

**SKU field behavior:**
- **With SKU:** `sku:WCP-0785` → Guaranteed correct, AI skips SKU extraction
- **Without SKU:** AI attempts to extract SKU from product page
- **Multi-variant pages:** Always specify SKU to avoid wrong variants

**Examples:**
```bash
# Exact SKU for multi-variant page (recommended for WCP, McMaster)
/requestpart subsystem:Drive link:https://wcproducts.com/products/ball-bearings sku:WCP-0785 qty:4

# Let AI detect SKU (works well for single-product pages)
/requestpart subsystem:Intake link:https://www.revrobotics.com/rev-21-1650/ qty:2

# No link, no SKU (manual entry by mentor)
/requestpart subsystem:Electrical notes:"5mm LED, red" qty:10
```

### `/cancelrequest` - Cancel Your Request
```
/cancelrequest 
  requestid:REQ-12345678    # Required: Your request ID
  reason:No longer needed   # Optional: Reason for cancellation
```

**Security:**
- Can only cancel your own requests
- Cannot cancel if status is Ordered, Received, or Complete
- Audit trail preserved in mentor notes
- Row turns gray, status becomes "🚫 Cancelled"

**Example:**
```
/cancelrequest requestid:REQ-a1b2c3d4 reason:Found alternative part
```

### `/inventory` - Search Inventory
```
/inventory sku:WCP-0783              # Exact SKU lookup
/inventory search:bearing            # Keyword search
/inventory search:BIN-001            # Location lookup
```

**Returns:**
- Part name
- SKU
- Vendor
- Quantity on-hand
- Location(s)

### `/openorders` - View Pending Orders
```
/openorders                          # Shows all non-received orders
```

**Displays:**
- Up to 15 open orders (not yet received)
- Up to 15 denied requests
- Order IDs, vendors, SKUs, status, ETAs

### `/orderstatus` - Check Status
```
/orderstatus requestid:REQ-1fd8b811  # Request details
/orderstatus orderid:ORD-a2b3c4d5    # Order details
```

**Request status shows:**
- Current status (Submitted, Approved, Ordered, etc.)
- Part details including user-specified or AI-detected SKU
- Linked orders (if any)

**Order status shows:**
- Order date
- ETA
- Tracking number
- Current status

## Troubleshooting

### SKU Field Not Appearing in Discord

**Problem:** `/requestpart` command doesn't show `sku` option

**Solution:**
```bash
# On your VM:
cd ~/8793PartBot/discord-bot

# Verify SKU field is in bot.js code
grep -n "setName('sku')" bot.js
# Should show 2 lines: one in /requestpart, one in /inventory

# Delete and re-register commands
pm2 delete discord-bot
pm2 start bot.js --name discord-bot
pm2 save

# Completely quit and reopen Discord
# (or use Discord in incognito browser)
```

### User SKU Not Being Saved

**Problem:** User specifies SKU but it doesn't appear in Google Sheets

**Check Apps Script Code.gs:**
1. Line ~191 in `handleDiscordRequest_` should have:
   ```javascript
   sku: body.sku || '',
   ```

2. Line ~243 in `createPartRequest_` should have:
   ```javascript
   if (data.sku) {
     sheet.getRange(nextRow, PART_REQUESTS_COLS.SKU).setValue(data.sku);
   }
   ```

3. Verify `PART_REQUESTS_COLS.SKU` points to correct column (usually column 6 = F)

4. Check Execution logs: Extensions → Apps Script → Executions
   - Look for: `[createPartRequest_] User provided SKU: WCP-0785`

### AI Not Extracting SKU (When User Doesn't Provide One)

**Problem:** AI enrichment fills Part Name but not SKU

**Common causes:**
1. **Multi-variant pages:** Use user SKU field instead
2. **Page fetch failed:** Check Execution logs for HTTP errors
3. **Gemini rate limit:** Free tier = 15 requests/minute
4. **Complex page structure:** Some vendor pages are hard to parse

**Solutions:**
- For multi-variant pages: Always use `sku:WCP-XXXX` parameter
- For single-product pages: Check Execution logs for specific errors
- Manual enrichment: Select row → **🎃 PartBot → ✨ Enrich Part Request**

### Bot Shows Offline in Discord
```bash
# Check if bot is running
pm2 status

# Check logs for errors
pm2 logs discord-bot --lines 50

# Verify environment variables
echo $DISCORD_TOKEN
echo $APPS_SCRIPT_URL

# Restart bot
pm2 restart discord-bot
```

### "Error from Sheets" Message
1. Check Apps Script **Executions** log (clock icon in Apps Script editor)
2. Look for errors in the execution details
3. Verify deployment is set to "Anyone" can access
4. Test Apps Script URL in browser (should show "OK FROM FRC PURCHASING WEB APP")

### "Request not found" Error (when canceling)
1. Verify request ID is correct (case-insensitive)
2. Check that request exists in Part Requests sheet
3. Run **🎃 PartBot → ⚙️ Setup Dropdown Workflow** to ensure validation includes Cancelled status

### Dropdown Validation Error
**Error:** "The data you entered in cell Q18 violates the data validation rules..."

**Fix:**
1. Run **🎃 PartBot → ⚙️ Setup Dropdown Workflow** in Google Sheets
2. This adds "🚫 Cancelled" to the allowed status values

## Best Practices

### When to Use the SKU Field

**✅ Always use SKU for:**
- Multi-variant product pages (WCP ball bearings, McMaster hardware)
- Parts with multiple size/color/type options on one page
- When you know the exact part number
- Critical parts where wrong variant = project failure

**⚠️ Optional for:**
- Single-product vendor pages (most REV/AndyMark products)
- Parts where AI can easily determine the SKU
- Prototyping parts where exact variant doesn't matter

**❌ Don't use SKU for:**
- Requests without a vendor link
- Generic part descriptions ("need M5 bolts")

**Examples:**

```bash
# GOOD: Multi-variant page with specific SKU
/requestpart subsystem:Drive link:https://wcproducts.com/products/ball-bearings sku:WCP-0785 qty:4

# GOOD: Single-product page, let AI detect
/requestpart subsystem:Intake link:https://www.revrobotics.com/rev-21-1650/ qty:2

# GOOD: McMaster with known part number
/requestpart subsystem:Mechanical link:https://mcmaster.com/93475A230/ sku:93475A230 qty:20

# BAD: Generic request (use notes instead)
/requestpart subsystem:Electrical notes:"Red 5mm LEDs" qty:10
```
